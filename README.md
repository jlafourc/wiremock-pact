# Wiremock PACT

Get requests from [Wiremock](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/) and create a pact JSON file. For publishing the JSON, you may want to look at [pact-jvm](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm/tree/master/provider).

This repostory contains:

 - `wiremock-pact-lib` - *A library that can transform WireMock [ServeEvent](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/stubbing/ServeEvent.java):s to PACT JSON.*
 - `wiremock-pact-extension` - *A WireMock extension that is intended to ease usage of the library.*
 - `wiremock-pact-example-springboot-app` - *A SpringBoot application that shows how it can be used.*
